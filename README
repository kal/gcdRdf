This script can be used to extract RDF data from a comics.org MySQL data dump.
To use:
	1) Load the comics.org data dump into a MySQL database.
	2) Copy the file config.py.template to config.py and edit it to provide the connection details for the database
	3) python dump.py
	4) The RDF is written to gcd.nt in NTriples format

Dependencies:
	This script was written and tested witn Python 2.7.2 and uses the MySQL Connector/Python library (https://launchpad.net/myconnpy) to talk to the database.
	
Notes:
	I recommend using UTF-8 as the collation for the MySQL database
